Steps in creating the application.

We start creating a folder for the application

Open the folder in visual studio code and snc the folder with one repository

Creating the composer.json file and commit to master
--with composer init--

Add ventor folder to git ignore and other files that we do not need

Start creating the structure of the application
- create a folder src to keep all the code there
- updating the composer with all the dependencies 
---install phph unit 
----create phpunit.xml
---install symfony console
--composer update--
--some testing to see if everything it's working

After we have created the index of our application, in our case exporter.php
we have to register a command for further development and testing
// ... register commands
$application->add(new ExporterController()); 

For this application we still have to create some code for catching and working with the exceptions.

Like format of a date to be Y-m-d
Like 30,31 February or 29 every 4 years, if is past as bonus day....

We can create more arguments for number of months, bonus day and the for the start day

About the structure....for speed reasons I made everything in ExporterFactory class
For a big project creating the data has to be in one class, and the code for 
creating and exporting the CSV file has to be in another class, 
parssing only some properties when the model is created
and then using only the properties/methods from the class

The end
